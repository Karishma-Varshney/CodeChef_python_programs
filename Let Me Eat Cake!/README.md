## Let Me Eat Cake!
Alice and Bob both bought a full cake each.
Alice's cake has 
A slices, and Bob's cake has 
B slices

Alice will be unhappy if she has strictly less slices than Bob does. Similarly, Bob will be unhappy if he has strictly less slices than Alice does.

Charlie doesn't want either of his friends to be unhappy, so he proposes a solution: while either Alice or Bob are unhappy, he will attempt to restore happiness by eating half the remaining slices (rounded up) of whoever has more of them.
For example,                                     

- If A=8 and B=5, Charlie will eat half of Alice's slices, which is 8/2=4 slices.
- If A=2 and B=5, Charlie will eat half of Bob's slices, which is 5/2 slices - rounded up, this is 3 slices.
How many slices of cake will Charlie eat in total?
The sample tests below have an explained example.

### Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
T
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of input contains two space-separated integers 
A and 
B
: Alice's and Bob's initial number of slices.
### Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the number of slices of cake Charlie will eat.

### Constraints
- 1â‰¤Tâ‰¤10^4

 
- 1â‰¤A,Bâ‰¤100
