# CodeChef coding Q29

## Approximate Answer
You are solving a problem whose correct answer is the integer 
Y.
The answer you obtained, however, is the integer 
X.

Your answer will be considered correct if the difference between 
X and 
Y is at most 
K.

In other words, your answer is considered correct if and only if:

âˆ£
X
âˆ’
Y
âˆ£
â‰¤
K

Given the values of 
X, 
Y, and 
K, determine whether your answer 
X is correct or not.



### Input Format
- The first and only line of input will contain three space-separated integers X, Y and K â€” your answer, the correct answer, and the maximum allowed difference, respectively.

### Output Format
Output the answer on a single line: "Yes" if your answer is considered correct, and "No" otherwise (without quotes).

Each letter of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase, i.e, the strings NO, no, No, and nO will all be treated as equivalent.
