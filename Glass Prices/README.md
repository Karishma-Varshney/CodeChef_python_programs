# CodeChef coding Q38

## Glass Price
Chef is buying spectacles, and is now deciding on which frame to purchase.

Chef has narrowed his options down to two choices: a plastic frame that costs 
X rupees, and a metal frame that costs 
Y rupees.

Chef will buy the metal frame if and only if it costs at most twice the price of the plastic frame - otherwise he will buy the plastic frame.

Can you decide which frame Chef will buy?

### Input Format
The first and only line of input will contain two integers 
X and 
Y - the price of the plastic frame and the metal frame, respectively.
### Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the answer: the type of frame Chef will purchase.
This is either the string "PLASTIC" or the string "METAL" (without quotes) depending on the outcome.

Each letter of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase - for example, the strings METAL, MeTaL, metal, and mEtAL will all be treated as equivalent.
